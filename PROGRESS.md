## 2026-05-08 17:30 — Strategic shift: dev-first wedge + local LLM in MVP

**Done:**
- Read PRD.md, RESEARCH.md, COMPETITIVE-LANDSCAPE.md.
- Confirmed the original "Tauri + local + cheap" cell is taken (Handy 14k★ MIT, MumbleFlow $5).
- Sharpened wedge in PRD.md to stack three claims no single competitor owns: (1) dev-first / code-aware out of the box, (2) local AI cleanup as headline / no API key required, (3) lifetime + GPLv3.
- Pulled **Code mode** forward from Sprint 2 → Sprint 1.
- Pulled **local LLM cleanup toggle** forward from V1.1 → Sprint 1 (via Ollama HTTP detection — bundled GGUF lands in Sprint 2 to keep MVP shippable).
- Brand voice locked: punk, anti-enterprise, fun. Anti-Wispr.
- License: GPLv3 (desktop core).

**Next:**
- Scaffold Tauri 2 app in `apps/desktop/` (React-TS template).
- Pin all dependency versions (Tauri 2.x, cpal, reqwest, etc.).
- Wire global hotkey (Right Option) → audio capture (cpal) → Groq Whisper Turbo → cleanup → clipboard paste.
- First end-to-end loop on macOS arm64 by tonight.

**Blocked:** none.
